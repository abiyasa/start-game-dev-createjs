Slide and example codes for http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-HTML5-User-Group/events/134406232/

## Installation

Make sure the following stuff are installed beforehand:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is installed
* [Grunt][grunt] is installed. You can install it manually by `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
* [Bower][bower] is installed. You can install it manually by `npm install -g bower`.

After cloning the repository, go to the directory and do:

* `npm install`
* `bower install`.

This will automatically install all required modules including the [CreateJS][createjs] library.

## Starting

Do `grunt` and this will start a local webserver (http://localhost:9001). Available URLs:
